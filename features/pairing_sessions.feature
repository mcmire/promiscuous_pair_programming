Feature: Managing pairing sessions
  In order to connect with other developers to pair on some code
  As a logged in user
  I want to be able to manage my pairing sessions.

  Background:
    Given the time is 2009-11-01 10:00 AM

  Scenario: Viewing my pairing sessions only shows me the pairing sessions that I have created
    Given a user "another user" exists
    And a pairing session exists with owner: user: "another user", description: "Help fix a bug"
    And a logged in user exists
    And a pairing session exists with owner: the user, description: "Patch Active Record"
    When I go to the root page
    And I follow "My Sessions" within the navigation
    Then I should see "Patch Active Record" within my pairing sessions
    And I should not see "Help fix a bug" within my pairing sessions

  Scenario: Viewing my pairing sessions only shows me the pairing sessions in the future
    Given a user "pair" exists with email: "pair@test.com", first_name: "Hello", last_name: "World"
    And a logged in user exists
    And the following pairing sessions exist
      | owner    | description                      | start_at            | end_at             | pair        |
      | the user | Future pairing session with pair | 2010-11-15 10:00 AM | 2010-11-15 11:00AM | user "pair" |
      | the user | Topic for past pairing session   | 2010-11-12 10:00 AM | 2010-11-12 11:00AM |             |
    And the time is "2010-11-13 10:00 AM"
    When I go to the root page
    And I follow "My Sessions" within the navigation
    Then I should see "Future pairing session with pair" within my pairing sessions
    And I should see "Yes" within my pairing sessions
    And I should not see "Topic for past pairing session" within my pairing sessions

  Scenario: Creating a new pairing session adds the new session to my pairing sessions
    Given I am logged in
    And the location of the new pairing session will be geolocated as "Boulder, CO"
    When I follow "New Pairing session"
    And I fill in "Start Date/Time" with "2010-11-12 10:00 AM"
    And I fill in "End Date/Time" with "2010-11-12 1:00 PM"
    And I fill in "Description" with "Work on RSpec bugs"
    And I fill in "Location" with "Boulder, CO"
    And I press "Create Pairing session"
    Then I should see "Pairing session was successfully created."
    And the "#my_pairing_sessions" table should contain:
